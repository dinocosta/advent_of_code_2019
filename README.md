# Advent Of Code 2019: Elixir

This repository contains solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) developed in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## Structure

For each day you have four files:

* The README which contains the problems for both part one and part two for the specific day
* The input file
* The solution for part one
* The solution for part two

Taking as example day 5 those files will be named `5.README.md`, `5.input.txt`, `5.1.exs` and `5.2.exs` respectively.

## Running

In order to run any of the solutions just do:

```bash
▲ elixir [DAY].[PART].exs
```

For example, running `▲ elixir 1.2.exs` will run the solution for part two of day one.
